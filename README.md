# C++ Lox Interpreter

This is a C++ implementation of the Lox interpreter from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom.
It's available [online for free](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html).

A learning exercise to keep myself sharp on parsers.

## Building
```bash
make
```

## Running
```bash
make run
```
or by finding the `lox` executable in the `build` directory.

## Testing
```bash
make test
```
or
```bash
make test-verbose
```

## Nuke the build
```bash
make clean
```
